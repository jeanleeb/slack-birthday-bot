# Channel Selection Improvements

This document outlines the changes made to improve the birthday channel selection functionality in the Slack Birthday Bot.

## Key Improvements

1. **User Interface Enhancement**
   - Changed from text-based input to a modal with channel dropdown selector
   - Added a button in the App Home to quickly change the channel
   - Improved instructions and user guidance

2. **Data Storage Improvements**
   - Now storing both channel ID and channel name for improved reliability
   - Prioritizing channel ID for message delivery, with fallback to channel name
   - Added safeguards against channel access issues

3. **Permission Handling**
   - Added automatic joining of channels when possible
   - Clear error messages when permission issues are encountered
   - Improved guidance for users on how to invite the bot to channels

4. **Technical Changes**
   - Updated OAuth scopes to include `channels:join` permission
   - Created a new modal view for channel selection
   - Added action handlers for UI elements
   - Updated documentation and command examples

## Affected Files

## Benefits

- **Reduced Errors**: Better validation and error handling for access issues.
- **More Flexibility**: Multiple ways to select channels (command, App Home button).

## Future Considerations
