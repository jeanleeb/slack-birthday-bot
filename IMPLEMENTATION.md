- `/csvtemplate` - Command to get a CSV template for importing birthdays
- `/debugcheckbirthdays` - Manually trigger the birthday check (for testing)
- `/debugsettoday [Name]` - Set your birthday to today's date (for testing)

## Components Created
1. **Database**
   - SQLite database for birthday and configuration storage
   - Models for Birthday and Config entities
   - Display name support in the Birthday model
   - Database-backed admin permissions system

2. **Commands**
   - Basic commands for setting and retrieving birthdays
   - Admin commands for managing birthdays of other users
   - Advanced import/export with CSV and JSON support
   - Admin permission management system
   - CSV validation and templates
   - Birthday-related commands (set, list, next, remove)
   - Display name management command
   - Channel configuration command
   - Administrative commands for managing other users' birthdays
   - Debug commands for testing

3. **Interactive Features**
   - App Home interface with birthday information display
   - Interactive buttons for updating and removing birthdays
   - Admin-specific controls for removing other users' birthdays
   - Confirmation modals for destructive actions
   - CSV validation and import tools

4. **Scheduler**
   - Daily birthday check at 9:00 AM using node-cron
   - Configured to send birthday messages to the chosen channel

4. **App Home**
   - Custom App Home view showing user's birthday
   - Displays upcoming birthdays
   - Provides command information

5. **Interactive Features**
   - Update birthday button in App Home
   - Modal form for birthday updates

## Technical Implementation
- Used Sequelize ORM for database interactions
- Implemented node-cron for scheduling
- Organized code following Bolt.js modular approach

## Testing
The bot can be tested using the debug commands to verify functionality without waiting
for actual birthdays:
1. Use `/debugsettoday` to set your birthday to today
2. Use `/debugcheckbirthdays` to manually trigger the birthday check
3. Verify the birthday message appears in the configured channel

## Recent Updates

### Timezone Handling Fix
To address an issue where birthdays were being saved to the previous day due to timezone conversions:

1. **Direct Date String Processing**
   - Modified date handling to avoid timezone conversion issues by directly parsing and storing date components
   - Fixed date extraction from the database to use consistent string formatting
   - Ensured date comparisons in the birthday scheduler correctly match stored dates
   - Enhanced date validation with proper numeric parsing

2. **Timezone-Aware Approach**
   - Ensured consistency in date displays across the app
   - Applied fixes in all date-handling code including:
     - Birthday commands
     - Admin commands
     - Scheduler
     - App Home interface
     - Debug commands
     - Birthday modals

By using direct string manipulation for dates rather than JavaScript Date objects where timezone conversion could occur, we've ensured that birthdays are stored and displayed correctly regardless of the server's timezone.

### Display Name Removal
To simplify the app and standardize on Slack's native @mentions:

1. **Removed display name functionality** throughout the codebase:
   - Removed `/setname` command 
   - Updated message formats to use @mentions only
   - Removed display name fields from forms/modals
   - Updated admin commands to not use display names
   - Simplified database schema and queries

2. **Date Format Standardization**:
   - Changed from MM/DD to DD/MM format
   - Fixed timezone issues with direct string parsing
   - Updated validation logic and date format displays

### Flexible Deployment Support

The bot now supports both Socket Mode and HTTP mode for deployment:

1. **Socket Mode** (Default)
   - Uses WebSocket connection - no public URL needed
   - Perfect for free hosting services or local development
   - Requires `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` and `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`

2. **HTTP Mode**
   - Uses traditional HTTP endpoints
   - Requires a public URL for your app
   - Uses `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET`, and `SLACK_REQUEST_URL`
   - Automatically handles Slack's URL verification challenge

The bot automatically detects which mode to use based on whether `SLACK_REQUEST_URL` is provided. See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed deployment instructions.

#### HTTP Mode URL Verification

When using HTTP mode, Slack requires verifying your endpoint URL. The app now includes:

- Automatic detection of Slack verification challenge requests
- Proper response with the challenge token to verify the endpoint
- Custom ExpressReceiver middleware to handle the verification process
- Detailed documentation about the verification process in [HTTP-VERIFICATION.md](HTTP-VERIFICATION.md)
- Testing tools to verify the verification handler works correctly

The verification happens when you first configure Event Subscriptions in your Slack app settings and enter your app's URL as the Request URL. Slack sends a request with a challenge parameter, and our app automatically responds correctly to complete the verification.

Comprehensive documentation is available in:
- [HTTP-MODE-SETUP.md](HTTP-MODE-SETUP.md) - Step-by-step setup guide
- [HTTP-MODE-TECHNICAL.md](HTTP-MODE-TECHNICAL.md) - Technical implementation details
- [VERIFICATION-TESTING.md](VERIFICATION-TESTING.md) - How to test the verification

The app is now ready for deployment to a Slack workspace!
